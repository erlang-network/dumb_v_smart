Traditional believing is, smart is always better and always win because it is assumed that it has some prior knowledge, which dumb does't have.  One interesting thing here is, I want to show you this may not always be true for random access channel design.

The principle of the dumb access protocol suggested here can be used for improving random access capacity.  The targeted applications, for example, includes improving IoT network capacity.
